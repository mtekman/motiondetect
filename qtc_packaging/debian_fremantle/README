The Debian Package motiondetect
----------------------------

* Motion Detector:
    * Slight bug that causes the app to crash when MotionDetector window is selected first. Very temperamental since it doesn't always happen the second time.
* TimeLapse:
    * Repeated calls to alarmd can cause the app to overload dbus. For this reason, the minimum time between intervals is restrictde to 20 seconds.
    * On the (not so unlikely) event that a scheduled task refuses to execute, a KILL_SWITCH has been implemented which is executed by pressing 'Delete All' then 'Delete Selected Job; then 'Set Job' in succession.
* Commandline:
    * Switches are available, both for Motion Detector and TimeLapse, but the TimeLapse switches are hidden (mostly because the user wont be able to do much with it).
    * Motion Detector calls using the cmdline interface can result in segmentation faults over large periods. Looking into it.
