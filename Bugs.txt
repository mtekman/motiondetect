Weird email error where it says that I should check to se if I have SMTP access to gmail...
--- Fixed. Turned out to be gmail wasnt configured properly.

Bug where FCam keeps using dark images as reference frames
---- Fixed. Turned out to be that I removed the histogram unit, which is necesary for the autoexpose alogirthm to work
--Added a small if statement that checks if totalN (which is now neccesary) is == 0. If so, the autoExpose alogirthm is once again called.


Removed Kernel dependece -- works with kernel-power51 just fine
